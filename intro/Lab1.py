# 1. Variable

# A variable is like container that holds values. 

# a = 10

# print(a)


print



# 2. Examples of variable names

# _underscore
# underscore_
# python_puppet
# pythonpuppet
# pythonPuppet
# totalbadpuns
# super_bad


# 3. Notable conventions for the variable identifiers 
# a.	Camel case : Second and subsequent words are capitalised : aquaMan
# b.	Pascal case : All the words are capitialised : AquaMan
# c.	Snake case : words are separated by underscores : aqua_man
# PEP 8 standard recommends snake case for variables and functions and the cap word pascal case for classes.


# 4. Examples

# # sfsfsdfsdfsafsd

# # sfsfsdfsdfsafsds

# # sdfsdfsdf


# num1 = 45
# num1 = 'Thius is num1'
# num1 = 0.999999999
# # num2 = input("enter second number")

# # num = a(num1) + (num2)

# print(num1)

# print(type(num1))

# aquaMan
# aquaMan
# aquaman1_ = 1




# 5. Exercise on Shell

# myFirstvariable
# myFirstvariable = 0
# myFirstvariable = ''
# myFirstvariable = ""
# myFirstvariable = False
# 0=myFirstvariable
# '' = myFirstvariable
# False = myFirstvariable





# 6. Chained assignment

# a = b = c = 300	 
# a, b, c = 300, 300, 300


# 7. Dynamic typing language

# Thing = "helo"
# yype(thing)
# Thing = 1212
# type(thing)



# 8. Location of the variable

# x = 0 

# id(x)


# 9. Deleting a variable

# del a 
# edl a, b
